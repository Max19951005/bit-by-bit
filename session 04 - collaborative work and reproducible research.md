### Collaboration and openness as a paradigm
* [Linus' law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law): Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow
* open source and open access
* crowdsourcing and the success of wikipedia
* importantly, and possibly counterintuitively, openness and transparancy have become a means for incentivizing quality rather than sloppiness.

#### Tools and packages
* general: [Github](www.github.com)
* collaborative writing: [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/) 
* [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) with R and Latex: The <strong>knitr</strong> package was designed to be a transparent engine for dynamic report generation with R, solve some long-standing problems in Sweave, and combine features in other add-on packages into one package (<strong>knitr</strong> &asymp; Sweave + cacheSweave + pgfSweave + weaver <code>animation::saveLatex</code> + <code>R2HTML::RweaveHTML</code> + <code>highlight::HighlightWeaveLatex</code> + 0.2 * brew + 0.1 * SweaveListingUtils + more).
