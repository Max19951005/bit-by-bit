### Collaboration and openness as a paradigm
* [Linus's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law): "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".
* `open source` and `open access`
* [crowdsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) and the [success of wikipedia](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/oct/26/g2.onlinesupplement)
* importantly, and possibly counterintuitively, openness and transparancy have become a means for [incentivizing quality](http://www.zdnet.com/article/coverity-finds-open-source-software-quality-better-than-proprietary-code/) rather than sloppiness; however, note [predatory open access publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_open_access_publishing)
* professional editors, too, can be fooled: [SciGen](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/) and [MathGen](http://thatsmathematics.com/mathgen/); for a history of hoaxes, see the [wikipedia-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIgen)
* pitfalls of popular, proprietary formats:
  * Fowler, Dan. 2017. “Excel Is Threatening the Quality of Research Data — Data Packages Are Here to Help.” February 22. http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/02/22/excel-is-threatening-the-quality-of-research-data-data-packages-are-here-to-help/.
  * Strasser, Carly. 2015. “Introduction to Open Science: Why Data Versioning and Data Care Practices Are Key for Science and Social Science.” February 9. http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/02/09/data-versioning-open-science/.

#### Tools and packages
* general: [Github](www.github.com)
  * Perkel, Jeffrey. 2016. “Democratic Databases: Science on GitHub.” *Nature News* 538 (7623): 127. doi:10.1038/538127a.
  * [Why we need a GitHub for science](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/04/we_need_a_github_for_academic_research.html)
  * and [why don't you try it out yourself](https://try.github.io/)?
* **collaborative writing**: [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/); also, note the existence of the [ctan](https://www.ctan.org/)-pages, a library for packages you may need to install when using LaTex. 
* [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/) for collaborative writing
* these days, google docs too has a nice LaTex (or more accurately, MathJax) integration: [Auto-LaTeX-equations](https://sites.google.com/site/autolatexequations/)
* [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) with R and Latex: "The <strong>knitr</strong> package was designed to be a transparent engine for dynamic report generation with R, solve some long-standing problems in Sweave, and combine features in other add-on packages into one package (<strong>knitr</strong> &asymp; Sweave + cacheSweave + pgfSweave + weaver <code>animation::saveLatex</code> + <code>R2HTML::RweaveHTML</code> + <code>highlight::HighlightWeaveLatex</code> + 0.2 * brew + 0.1 * SweaveListingUtils + more)."
* Overleaf with [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/); compare this [(rather long) case-study](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/529-case-study-an-introduction-to-code-ocean-creating-and-uploading-content-into-overleaf)
* comparable to the aforementioned Ctan-pages, there exists a library for R-packages, which is called [Cran](https://cran.r-project.org).
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/): "Project Jupyter is an open source project was born out of the <a href="https://ipython.org">IPython Project</a> in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages. Jupyter will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">modified BSD license</a>"
* [Stencila](https://stenci.la/): "The calls for research to be transparent and reproducible have never been louder. But today's tools for reproducible research can be intimidating - especially if you're not a coder. We're building software for reproducible research with the intuitive, visual interfaces that you and your colleagues are used to."
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [Weave.jl](https://github.com/mpastell/Weave.jl): is this the 'dynamic documents' of the (immediate) future?
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): "Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.
You'll love the slick user interface, extraordinary features and amazing performance."; for chromebook users, see [Caret](http://thomaswilburn.net/caret/)
* **data sharing**: [figshare](https://figshare.com/), [zenodo](https://www.zenodo.org/), and [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/); [OpenAire](https://www.openaire.eu/), and Harvard's [DataVerse](https://dataverse.org/)-project
* as an important player, [Nature has started to take the reproducibility very seriously](https://www.nature.com/news/announcement-towards-greater-reproducibility-for-life-sciences-research-in-nature-1.22062?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews&sf84509261=1).
* the quest for transparency may even change the process of scientific publishing: see, for instance, [ScienceOpen](https://www.scienceopen.com/), "a professional networking platform for scholars to enhance their research in the open, make an impact, and receive credit for it. We provide context building services for publishers, to bring researchers closer to the content than ever before."
